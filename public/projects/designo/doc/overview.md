This is a multi-page website built with Next.js, TypeScript, SASS and integrated with Strapi CMS. 

This is my attempt for the challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/designo-multipage-website-G48K6rfUT). You can see my solution [here](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/multi-page-website-built-with-nextjs-typescript-sass-strapi-v0NHptnMwE).

## üßê Why I built this? 

I built this project to practice my skills in Next.js, TypeScript and SASS. I also wanted to practice my design skills and improve my ability to convert a design into a website.

Also, I wanted to practice integrating a CMS into a website. I chose Strapi because it is a headless CMS that is easy to use and has a lot of useful features.

## üöÄ Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and works on all screen sizes.
- **Multi-page**: The website has multiple pages: Home, About, Locations, Contact.
- **CMS Integration**: The website is integrated with Strapi CMS. The content is fetched from the CMS and displayed on the website.
- **Server Side Rendering**: The website is built with Next.js which provides server side rendering for better performance and SEO.
- **Form Submission**: The contact form on the Contact page is fully functional. When the form is submitted, the data is sent to a Strapi API endpoint and saved in the CMS.
